# School_District_Analysis
We'll be using Python 3.7.11 from the development environment which we created for this project in Anaconda-Pandas

### The analysis strategies and goals

  The main goal of the analysis is to evaluate the performance of all the students in a specific district area. With all gathered data related to students' grades (in reading and math), school budget, and structures; it will be possible to assess the following:
  
  - An overview of the key metrics for each school.
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  -	The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  -	The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
	- School performance based on the budget per student
  -	School performance based on the school size 
	- School performance based on the type of school

However, the school board had notified that the data showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Therefore, it was requested to not add the math and reading scores of the ninth graders into account. The analysis were re-done in order to get the correct results.


#### First results:

  Starting with the top and botton schools according to the student overall performance on the exams:

#### School performance by BUDGET PER STUDENT / SCHOOL SIZE / TYPE OF SCHOOL

- Budget per Student:

The removal of the Ninth Grader scores from Thomas High School did not show a change in the final numbers. That is, because, the rounding of the averages and percentages, and the great amount of student data, ended up hiding and visible numerical changes.
